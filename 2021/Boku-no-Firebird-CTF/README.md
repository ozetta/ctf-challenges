Boku no Firebird CTF
===

## Description

CTF players must know how to steal flags from opponent.

http://example.com:8005

```
Username: Firebird
Password: F!reb1rd
```

Attachment: bot.py

Remarks: 
1. Your opponent will submit the flag once they found you have logged out (to prevent sniffing?)
2. The backend is fake, all data are stored in your cookie. Feel free to XSS without interfering others
3. If you have stolen the flag, don't bother to submit to the "Internal CTF" as it will say wrong
4. By design you can solve it even without RequestBin but yeah whatever
